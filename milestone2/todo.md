- [x] **P1 FIX**: Respect retry.enabled=false (changed Enabled from bool to *bool to distinguish "not set" from "explicitly false")

- [x] **P1 FIX**: Apply default jitter_percent=20 when retry enabled but jitter_percent unset (prevents thundering herd)
- [x] **P1 FIX**: Restore default retries when customizing delay in uploader constructor (pointer semantics: nil=default, &0=explicit)
- [x] **P1 FIX**: Guard clock skew interval against non-positive durations (prevents panic in time.NewTicker)
- [x] **P2 FIX**: Honor zero jitter configuration (changed JitterPercent to *int to distinguish "not set" from "explicitly 0")
- [x] **P1 FIX**: Clamp WAL checkpoint interval against non-positive durations (prevents panic in time.NewTicker)
- [x] **P1 FIX**: Convert max_attempts (total attempts) to maxRetries (number of retries) correctly (subtract 1 and clamp at 0)

## Final Acceptance Checklist

### Database & Storage
- [x] Schema migration from M1 to M2 succeeds (migrations v4, v5)
- [x] dedup_key field added with unique index
- [x] Value type field added (value_text, value_type)
- [x] Sessions table created
- [x] Same metrics retried → UNIQUE constraint error (no duplicates)
- [x] Dedup keys regenerated with new format (backwards compatible)
- [x] uploaded field added and indexed (already done in v2)
- [x] upload_checkpoints table created with batch tracking (already done in v2)

- [x] GetUnuploadedMetrics() returns only unuploaded
- [ ] Checkpoint tracking persists across restarts
- [x] WAL checkpoint routine implemented (CheckpointWAL, GetWALSize)
- [ ] WAL size stays <64 MB under load (needs background routine)

### Upload Fix
- [x] No duplicate uploads verified with integration test (TestNoDuplicateUploads_SameBatchRetried)
- [x] Upload loop queries only uploaded=0 AND value_type=0 (QueryUnuploaded filters numeric only)

- [x] Upload count reflects only numeric metrics sent to VM (P1 fix)
- [x] Meta-metrics accurately report actual uploads (not just processed)
- [x] Checkpoint advances correctly per chunk (MarkUploaded called after each batch)
